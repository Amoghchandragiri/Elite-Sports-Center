## Project Description
Explore our wide range of indoor and outdoor sports activities and you can select your preferred choice of sports activities whose description is given in the upcoming pages. A feedback form has been created to get an idea about how the customers perceive our Sports center and to address their issues.
I am open to any changes made in my project and would like to invite all of you to collaborate with me and introduce some cool changes which would make the website make more responsive and dynamic in nature. You can clone this repository on github by following the below command:-

Now you can make your changes and then add them and do a commit and finally push to remote branch; say you are on master.

```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m <"Initial commit">
```
```
git push origin master
